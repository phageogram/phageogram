- 👋 Hi, I’m @phageogram
- 👀 I’m interested in all kinds of things, including backend programming, data analytics, and data engineering. Outside of tech, I'm interested in creative writing, philosophy, economics, and climate resiliency in urban environments.
- 🌱 I’m currently dipping my toes into data engineering! I recently built my first functional pipeline in Python and am orchestrating it now. I'm also, very slowly, learning Rust and would like to commit more time to it in the future.
- 💞️ I’m looking to gain open source experience. I'm an active contributor to the Distribute Aid open source project and am actively looking for new projects to work on.
- 📫 Shoot me an email! phageogram@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He / Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I also have a blue belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and have travelled extensively.
